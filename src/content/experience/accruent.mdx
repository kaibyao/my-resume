Designed and built a suite of web applications and partner integrations to help healthcare technicians manage and maintain medical devices.

#### Contributions:
* Built tooling to speed up development & deployment processes:
  * Wrote a code modification tool to convert a legacy JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.
  * Wrote a tool to transpile modern TypeScript to a non-standard format of JavaScript (used by the ServiceNow platform).
  * Wrote a tool to package and deploy code updates to ServiceNow instances.
* Wrote an integration to allow for real-time synchronization of medical device statuses & physical locations to/from a 3rd party real-time locating system (Midmark RTLS).
* Built an offline-first web application to allow for technicians to update work orders while in an offline-first environment (such as in an MRI room, where wireless internet is not allowed).
* Established code review and SDLC processes to stabilize deployments / long-term maintenance.
* Spearheaded the improvement of our development processes via tactical meetings & documentation.
* Took over interim product management duties to help keep the team moving.

#### Technologies used:
* UIs written in ***HTML + Sass CSS (SCSS)***, ***JavaScript + TypeScript***, and ***React + Redux***.
* Offline-first functionality using ***Service Workers***
* Application stack built on the ***ServiceNow*** platform.
