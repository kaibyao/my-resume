# My Resum√©

Once upon a time, people (myself included) wrote their resum√©s using an application called Microsoft Word. These days, I rarely use Word and don‚Äôt have it installed on any of my machines.

At some point I had converted my resum√© to the Adobe Illustrator (and later Affinity Designer) format, but found that as I stopped using Illustrator day-to-day, my muscle memory of its actions faded and I had a harder time editing previous job experiences + adding new ones. I also found that it‚Äôs not actually that great of a tool when the main thing wanted to do was edit text.

Now, given how far we‚Äôve come with web frameworks and given that I will probably always be writing web applications as my day job, why not convert my resum√© to code? This repo houses my current resum√©, built on [React](https://react.dev/) + [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro makes it easy to immediately get started with writing textual information in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/), while still allowing for UI customization via React.

## üßû Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
