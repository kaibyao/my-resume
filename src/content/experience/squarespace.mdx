Implemented product features across the tech stack for an application that helps restaurant managers and hosts manage reservations, while considering real-time device syncing and user accessibility issues. This included: bookings, menus, check-ins, and payment/refunds.

* Implemented model/database relations, business logic, API endpoints, and UIs + forms in order to redesign a menu system that allows restaurants to reuse menus across different experiences. This deduplicated/normalized data and made restaurant offerings easier to manage for restaurant managers. <SkillsNotificationButton client:load skills={['TypeScript', 'React', 'Java (Guice)', 'MySQL', 'Redis', 'Hibernate ORM', 'GraphQL (Apollo)', 'WebSockets', 'REST', 'Jest', 'testing-library', 'JUnit', 'Selenium']} />
* Designed and built data hierarchy + configuration logic + UIs (both internal and customer-facing) for a new tax system, guaranteeing the company’s compliance with the tax legislation of several US states as a marketplace facilitator following the company’s acquisition and public listing. <SkillsNotificationButton client:load skills={['TypeScript', 'React', 'Java (Guice)', 'MySQL', 'Redis', 'Hibernate ORM', 'GraphQL (Apollo)', 'REST', 'Jest', 'testing-library', 'JUnit']} />
* Improved functionality to the reservation management application, which increased Restaurant Host user satisfaction and reduced maintenance overhead for product team members. <SkillsNotificationButton client:load skills={['TypeScript', 'React', 'Java (Guice)', 'MySQL', 'Hibernate ORM', 'GraphQL (Apollo)', 'WebSockets', 'REST', 'Jest', 'testing-library', 'JUnit', 'Selenium']} />
