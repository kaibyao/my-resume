# My R√©sum√©

Once upon a time, people wrote their r√©sum√©s using an application called Microsoft Word. These days, I don‚Äôt even have it installed on any of my machines.

At some point I had converted my r√©sum√© to Adobe Illustrator (and later Affinity Designer), but found that as I stopped using Illustrator day-to-day, my muscle memory of its actions faded and I had a harder time editing previous job experiences + adding new ones. I also found that it‚Äôs not actually that great of a tool when the main thing I needed to do was edit text.

Now, given how far we‚Äôve come with web frameworks and knowing that I will probably always be programming, why not convert my r√©sum√© to code? This repo houses my current r√©sum√©, built on [React](https://react.dev/) + [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro makes it easy to edit textual information in [Markdown (MDX)](https://mdxjs.com/), while still allowing for the sprinkles of UI interaction that I need.

## üßû Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
